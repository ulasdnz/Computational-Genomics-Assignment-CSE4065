In this assignment, we search for motifs, and try to find the consensus string.
We implement Median String algorithm, Randomized Motif Search and Gibbs Sampler, run all algorithms and compare the scores and consensus strings
obtained for different k values. The dnabase.txt file is the input file which contains the alignments. Read the Assignment.pdf file for more details about the project.
